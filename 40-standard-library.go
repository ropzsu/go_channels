bufio
Package bufio implements buffered I/O. It wraps an io.Reader or io.Writer object, creating another object (Reader or Writer) that also implements the interface but provides buffering and some help for textual I/O.
builtin
Package builtin provides documentation for Go's predeclared identifiers.
bytes
Package bytes implements functions for the manipulation of byte slices.
compress
container
context
Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.
crypto
Package crypto collects common cryptographic constants.
database
debug
embed
Package embed provides access to files embedded in the running Go program.
encoding
Package encoding defines interfaces shared by other packages that convert data to and from byte-level and textual representations.
errors
Package errors implements functions to manipulate errors.
expvar
Package expvar provides a standardized interface to public variables, such as operation counters in servers.
flag
Package flag implements command-line flag parsing.
fmt
Package fmt implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.
go
hash
Package hash provides interfaces for hash functions.
html
Package html provides functions for escaping and unescaping HTML text.
image
Package image implements a basic 2-D image library.
index
io
Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
log
Package log implements a simple logging package.
math
Package math provides basic constants and mathematical functions.
mime
Package mime implements parts of the MIME spec.
net
Package net provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP, UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.
os
Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality.
path
Package path implements utility routines for manipulating slash-separated paths.
plugin
Package plugin implements loading and symbol resolution of Go plugins.
reflect
Package reflect implements run-time reflection, allowing a program to manipulate objects with arbitrary types.
regexp
Package regexp implements regular expression search.
runtime
Package runtime contains operations that interact with Go's runtime system, such as functions to control goroutines.
sort
Package sort provides primitives for sorting slices and user-defined collections.
strconv
Package strconv implements conversions to and from string representations of basic data types.
strings
Package strings implements simple functions to manipulate UTF-8 encoded strings.
sync
Package sync provides basic synchronization primitives such as mutual exclusion locks.
syscall
Package syscall contains an interface to the low-level operating system primitives.
testing
Package testing provides support for automated testing of Go packages.
text
time
Package time provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.
unicode
Package unicode provides data and functions to test some properties of Unicode code points.
unsafe
Package unsafe contains operations that step around the type safety of Go programs.
